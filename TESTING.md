In this section, you need to convince the assessors that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well.
Essentially, in this part, you should go over all of your project's features, and ensure that they all work as intended,
with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Feature-by-Feature Testing:

Go through each feature of your portfolio site and detail the testing process for each.

Explain the functionality and demonstrate how it aligns with the intended purpose. This could include:

- Navigation: Ensuring smooth transitions between pages, links directing to the correct destinations.
- Responsive Design: Checking for compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
- Portfolio Display: Verifying that projects are properly showcased with accurate descriptions, images, and links.
- Contact Form: Testing the form submission process, ensuring the user receives a confirmation, and you receive the message.

User Experience Testing:

- Usability Testing: Have users (or simulated users) interact with the site and provide feedback. Document any issues encountered and the resolutions implemented.
- Accessibility Testing: Confirm compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., screen reader compatibility, proper alt text for images, keyboard navigation).

Compatibility Testing:

- Browser Compatibility: Testing on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.) to ensure consistent performance.
- Device Compatibility: Ensuring functionality across various devices (desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones).
- Performance Testing (optional):
	- Speed and Load Testing: Tools like PageSpeed Insights or GTmetrix to check page load times and optimize where necessary.
	- Scalability Testing: Assess how the site handles increased traffic or usage.

Regression Testing:

After implementing fixes or updates, ensure that previous features and functionalities still work as intended. This prevents new changes from breaking existing features.

Documentation and Logs:

Maintain records of testing procedures, results, and any bugs encountered along with their resolutions. This helps demonstrate a systematic approach to testing and problem-solving.
User Feedback Incorporation:

If applicable, mention how user feedback has been taken into account and implemented to enhance the user experience.

## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

| Directory | File | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | index.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/validate-html-index.png) | |
|  | upcoming.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/validate-html-upcoming.png) | |

|  | confirmation.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/validate-html-confirmation.png) | |
|  | 404.html | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/validate-html-404.png) | |


### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

| Directory | File | Screenshot | Notes |

| assets | style.css | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/validate-css.png) | |

## Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

| Browser | Home | Upcoming Events | Newsletter | Confirmation | 404 | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/chrome/chrome-index.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/chrome/chrome-upcoming.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/chrome/chrome-newsletter.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/chrome/chrome-confirmation.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/chrome/chrome-404.png) | Works as expected |

## Responsiveness

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various device sizes.

The minimum requirement is for the following 3 tests:
- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested responsiveness, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Using the "amiresponsive" mockup image (or similar) does not suffice the requirements.
Consider using some of the built-in device sizes in the Developer Tools.

If you have tested the project on your actual mobile phone or tablet, consider also including screenshots of these as well.
It showcases a higher level of manual tests, and can be seen as a positive inclusion!

Sample responsiveness testing documentation:

## Lighthouse Audit

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports.
Avoid testing the local version (especially if developing in Gitpod), as this can have knock-on effects of performance.

If you don't have Lighthouse in your Developer Tools,
it can be added as an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Don't just test the home page (unless it's a single-page application).
Make sure to test the Lighthouse Audit results for all of your pages.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Sample Lighthouse testing documentation:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

## User Story Testing

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Testing user stories is actually quite simple, once you've already got the stories defined on your README.

Most of your project's **features** should already align with the **user stories**,
so this should as simple as creating a table with the user story, matching with the re-used screenshot
from the respective feature.

## Bugs

- A screenshot for the README.md was named bgfc-title&hero.png so was changed to bgfc-title-hero.png to remedy any issues that would have been caused.

> [!NOTE]  
> There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
