## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | index.html | [Validate index.html](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https://apeskinian.github.io/p1_bgfc/index.html) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/validate-html-index.png) |

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

## Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

| Browser | Home | Upcoming Events | Newsletter | Confirmation | 404 | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/chrome/chrome-index.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/chrome/chrome-upcoming.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/chrome/chrome-newsletter.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/chrome/chrome-confirmation.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/chrome/chrome-404.png) | Works as expected |
| Firefox | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/firefox/firefox-index.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/firefox/firefox-upcoming.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/firefox/firefox-newsletter.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/firefox/firefox-confirmation.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/firefox/firefox-404.png) | Works as expected |

## Responsiveness

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various device sizes.

The minimum requirement is for the following 3 tests:
- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested responsiveness, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Using the "amiresponsive" mockup image (or similar) does not suffice the requirements.
Consider using some of the built-in device sizes in the Developer Tools.

If you have tested the project on your actual mobile phone or tablet, consider also including screenshots of these as well.
It showcases a higher level of manual tests, and can be seen as a positive inclusion!

## Lighthouse Audit

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports.
Avoid testing the local version (especially if developing in Gitpod), as this can have knock-on effects of performance.

If you don't have Lighthouse in your Developer Tools,
it can be added as an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Don't just test the home page (unless it's a single-page application).
Make sure to test the Lighthouse Audit results for all of your pages.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Sample Lighthouse testing documentation:

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

| Home | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/lighthouse-home-mobile.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/lighthouse-home-desktop.png) | Some minor warnings |
| About | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/lighthouse-about-mobile.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/lighthouse-about-desktop.png) | Some minor warnings |
| Gallery | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/lighthouse-gallery-mobile.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/lighthouse-gallery-desktop.png) | Slow response time due to large images |

## User Story Testing

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Testing user stories is actually quite simple, once you've already got the stories defined on your README.

Most of your project's **features** should already align with the **user stories**,
so this should as simple as creating a table with the user story, matching with the re-used screenshot
from the respective feature.

| User Story | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| As a new site user, I would like to learn about what happens at the club, so that I can decide whether I would like to try it. | ![screenshot](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-what-who-where.png) |
| As a new site user, I would like to find out where the club meets, so that I can see if it's local enough for me. | ![screenshot](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-map.png) |
| As a new site user, I would like to learn when the next meetup is, so that I can see if I can attend that time. | ![screenshot](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-upcoming-page.png) |
| As a returning site user, I would like to be kept up to date with events, so that I can see what's happening at the next meet. | ![screenshot](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-upcoming-page.png) |
| As a returning site user, I would like to know about past events I may have missed, so that I can catch up on what happened and who won the last tournament. | ![screenshot](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-newsletter-page.png) |

## Bugs

- A screenshot for the README.md was named bgfc-title&hero.png so was changed to bgfc-title-hero.png to remedy any issues that would have been caused.

> [!NOTE]  
> There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
