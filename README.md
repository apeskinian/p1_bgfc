Board Game & Film Club is a site to inform people about their local club in Maidstone where they can come and play games and watch films. It is targeted at both current members and potential new members who want a bit of classic fun and to make new friends. It will be useful to current and new members as it lists event details for future meets and also gives the opportunity to sign up to a newsletter via email.

## UX

The strategy was to create an easy to navigate website that introduced potential new members to the club and also gave existing members useful information about the club.

The scope of features I wanted to include were:
- Information on what the club is and what it's about (targeted at potential new members)
- Location of the club (targeted at potential new members)
- Dates of future events including what is happening on each date (for both existing and new members)
- A signup page for a newsletter for the club (for both existing and new members)

When looking at the site structure I decided all the information solely targeted for potential new members need to be on the homepage. This way there should be enough information about the club for them to decide if they would be interested. Information on the upcoming events on it's own page for two reasons, progressive disclosure for potential new members and also exising members can just bookmark this page rather than having to scroll past content they don't need. The newsletter form would be on it's on page as well.

While wireframing the site I decided to have the navbar at the bottom with a burger menu style for the smaller devices such as phones and tablets. This will make navigation easier when they are being browsed one handed. On larger devices the navbar moves back to the top. The images for the site were chosen that matched the content of the site and also were for a game that is very well known.

I then used the chosen hero image to generate the colour scheme for the site so that everything looked good together.

### Colour Scheme

- `#3a3a3a` Used for main home page text.
- `#f5f5f5` Used for header and rest of site primary text.
- `#3b4d66` Used as background for navbars and info boxes.
- `#f2eace` Used as background for footer.
- `#3b4d66` Used for social network icons and pop up navbar text.

I used [Colormind](http://colormind.io/) to generate my colour palette from the hero image.

### Typography

- [Fjalla One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fjalla+One) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Cantarell](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cantarell) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site for the social media icons in the footer.

## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

## Features
- ### Title & Hero Image
  - The title for the homepage floats above the hero image and scrolls with the page. The image used is a classic boardgame which is eyecatching and instantly recognisable. When the upcoming page is being viewed on tablet size and above, the title remains in place while the content scrolls next to it.

    ![Homepage title and hero image](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-title-hero.png "Homepage title and hero") ![Upcoming title with scrolling content](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-upcoming-title.png "Upcoming title and scrolling content")    

- ### Navigation Bar
  - The navigation bar appears differently depending on whether the user is on a hand held mobile device such as phones and tablets, or using larger devices such as Laptops and Desktops.
  - Hand held devices have the navigation bar at the bottom with a burger menu to access the links. This is for easier one handed accessibility. 
  
    ![Mobile nar bar](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-mobile-nav.png "Mobile nav bar")
  
  - Larger devices have the navigation bar at the top of the page and the links are expanded so in view all the time.

    ![Larger nav bar](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-larger-nav.png "Larger device nav bar")

- ### Club details section
  - This section tells the user the important information about the club including links to the appropriate sections of the site for more details on location, upcoming events and how to sign up to the newsletter.

    ![Info section](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-what-who-where.png "Information section")

- ### Map integration
  - The embedded Google map shows the location of where the club meets. This is for potential new members so they can see exactly where to find the club.
  - The link to open the larger map opens in a separate tab.

    ![Map section](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-map.png "Google map for location")

- ### Footer
  - The footer has the links to the clubs social media. This encourages the user to conmect via social media.
  - Links open in a separate tab.

    ![Social media footer](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-socials.png "Social media links")

- ### Upcoming Events page
  - This section of the site gives both current members and potential new members all the info they need on what's happening in upcoming meets.
  - This gives them the ability to plan whether they want to attend certain dates or not.

    ![Upcoming events](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-upcoming-page.png "Upcoming page")

- ### Newsletter page
  - This page gives the user the option to sign up to an email newsletter that would send out info about the club.
  - This might include highlights of the last meet, details on the next few meets and any other interesting news.

    ![Newsletter page](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-newsletter-page.png "Newsletter page")

- ### Newsletter confirmation page
  - This page confirms that the form submission has been successful and that they are signed up to receive the newsletter.

    ![Newsletter confirmation page](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-confirmation.png "Newsletter confirmation page")

- ### 404 Error page
  - This page shows up when there has been a 404 error. It gives the user options to navigate to other pages of the site.

    ![404 page](documentation/screenshots/bgfc-404.png "404 page")

### Future Features

  - I would like to add a feature on the pages that the floating title scrolls. When the title scrolls out of view I'd like to change it to a static bar at the top similar to the navbar when it is at the top.
  - A forum page would also be good for members as they can discuss future meets, ideas about the club and connect.
  - It would be good for the data in the newsletter submission to actually be sent to the author of the website so that a newsletter can be sent.
